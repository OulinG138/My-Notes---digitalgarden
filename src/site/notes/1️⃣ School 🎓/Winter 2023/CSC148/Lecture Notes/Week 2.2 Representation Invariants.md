## What is Representation Invariants
- **Definition**: A representation invariant is a property of the instance  
attributes that every instance of a class must satisfy.
- Example:
	- (in words) This tweet’s content is at most 280 characters.
	- (in code) `len(self.content) <= 280`
- Why should we care about representation invariants?
	- Undocumented assumptions/conditions is a huge source of bugs!
- *When given an instance of that class, we can assume that every representation invariants is satisfied.*

## Strategies
1. **Use preconditions**
	- Require client code to call methods with “good” inputs.  Make no promises if it doesn’t. Therefore, the method doesn’t need to check that preconditions are met.

2. **Ignore bad inputs**
	- Accept a wide range of inputs. If an input would cause an RI to be violated, do not perform the work of the method. Also known as *failing silently*.

3. **Fix "bad" inputs**
	- Accept a wide range of inputs. If an input would cause an RI to be violated, change the input to a “reasonable” or default value. Then continue with the rest of the method.
